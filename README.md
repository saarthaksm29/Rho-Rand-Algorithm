# Rho-Rand-Algorithm

The following implementation is for one of the most widely used Algorithm in Reinforcement Learning, the Rho-Rand Strategy

The Rho-Rand algorithm is the best way to represent the logarithmic regret in case of Multi-Users Policy. The regret increases till the learning is incomplete and
then once it is done then the regret remains constant for the next duration of the whole process.
